where to put h1

to know: you cant use ::before and ::after on input because they have no content

to make a radio button a rectangle
    appearance: none;
    width: auto;
    height: 100%;

made label visibility hidden in order to improve the accessiblity of the website.
Any other idea???

Used for turning off the arrows from number input

input::-webkit-outer-spin-button,
input::-webkit-inner-spin-button {
  -webkit-appearance: none;
}
